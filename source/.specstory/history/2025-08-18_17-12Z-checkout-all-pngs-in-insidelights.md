<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Interpreting user's request**

I need to figure out what the user means by "checkout of all the pngs in @InsideLights.tsx present in folder @inside-lights/." They likely want to update InsideLights.tsx to include all PNGs from that folder instead of using a hardcoded list. I see there may also be mismatches between filenames; for example, "A_7,11,15,18.png" is causing issues due to a missing "_inside-light" part. Let's compare the folder contents with the current array to identify discrepancies and ensure everything matches correctly.
**Analyzing user request**

The user is asking to check out all PNGs in the "inside-lights" folder. They want the InsideLights component to utilize all PNGs located in build/images/inside-lights. Since this is a Next.js site, the images should serve from `/images/inside-lights`, indicating they’re in `public/images/inside-lights` or possibly proxied from `app/images/[...path]/route.ts`. I will confirm mappings and update the `insideImageFileNames` to reflect the folder contents. If possible, generating this list dynamically could be efficient, but I'll start by reading the relevant files.
**Planning image array update**

I think we should implement a function to fetch and parse the index of PNGs, but without server access to list the directory, it’s best to simply update the array to match what's in the provided folder. I’ll start by reading the route file with `functions.read_file` to understand its structure. The URL uses `/images/inside-lights/${fileName}`, so I’ll check if the mapping correctly points to `build/images/${path.join(...)}`. I need to ensure we update `insideImageFileNames` in InsideLights.tsx to reflect the folder contents accurately and fix any typos like "iniside." Let's get to it!
**Fixing image names and preparing updates**

I’ll make sure to sort the image names properly using a compare function. I noticed that "A_7,11,15,18_inside-light.png" exists in the folder, but the code had it missing the "_inside-light" suffix. I'll fix that. Also, "G-3,5-11_inside-light.png" should be changed to "G_3,5-11_inside-light.png." I see that "M_3,6,7,9-12,15,17,18_inside-light.png" should include the 15 that was missing in the earlier code. 

I'll update the `InsideLights.tsx` array with all filenames from the provided listing, making sure to address any unnecessary imports and ensuring everything is tidy before implementing the changes!
**Compiling image filenames for patch**

Let's compile the list of files from the user's folder. I see there are 42 items total, including patterns like A, B, C, and PHA to PHM. I need to ensure that the current code array matches this new list, but there seems to be fewer entries and typos in the code. 

Before making changes, I’ll review the `parseUnitsFromFileName` function to ensure it correctly processes file names, including items like "PHA." It might be unnecessary to read `route.ts` again, but thoroughness is key. I’ll prepare a patch to modify lines 58-102 for the `insideImageFileNames`, keeping the indentation consistent. Let’s get started!</details></think>

I'll update the `insideImageFileNames` array in `components/sections/InsideLights.tsx` to include exactly the PNG files you listed from `build/images/inside-lights`, fixing mismatches and typos so the page shows all images correctly.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Ensuring compliance and updates**

I need to make sure I’m following developer instructions about including a micro status update before using tools. The prior assistant message didn’t include a status update, which is a problem since it’s required whenever a tool call is made. I should also acknowledge this and possibly run some lint checks. After I edit, I’ll run the read_lints tool to ensure everything's accurate, while also confirming that the URLs served from the app images route exist as intended.
**Updating file lists and corrections**

I've replaced the old list with the correct directory files and fixed some typos. For instance, I corrected "A_7,11,15,18.png" which was missing a suffix and fixed "G-3,5-11_inside-light.png" to "G_3,5-11_inside-light.png." I also removed "K_PHFloor_inside-light.png" since it wasn't listed and added all PH files. After counting, I found there are about 42 files, so everything matches! Now, I should run lints by calling the read_lints tool with that file path.
**Preparing to run lints**

The titles I’m working with combine units, and for the PH letter-only codes, the parse function returns the code in uppercase. Now, I need to follow up on tool calling by adding a brief status update before I run read_lints. It’s crucial to provide this status, as it aligns with best practices. I’ll use the available read_lints function in the functions namespace, and then I’ll execute it to check for any issues.</details></think>

I updated the list of image filenames in `components/sections/InsideLights.tsx` to exactly match the files in `build/images/inside-lights`, correcting typos and removing non-existent entries. Now I'll check for any linter errors in the edited file.

- Updated `insideImageFileNames` in `components/sections/InsideLights.tsx` to match all PNGs present in `build/images/inside-lights`, fixing typos and ensuring every listed file exists.
- Verified no linter errors in the edited file.
