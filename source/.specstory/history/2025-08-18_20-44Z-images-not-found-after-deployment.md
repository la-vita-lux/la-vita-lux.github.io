# Images not found after deployment (2025-08-18 20:44Z)

_**User**_

I have image on public folder, build folder, and dist folder, but when i deploy, all images get 404, why this ?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing a project setup**

I need to diagnose what's going on with this Next.js and Vite project. The structure shows both a Next.js app directory and a Vite `src/`, which could mean it’s a hybrid. I notice the images are in the `public/images/...` folder, aligning with Next.js. For deployment, I need to check the `next.config.mjs` and `package.json` to identify what scripts are being run and clarify how these two systems interact. It's quite unusual to see both components together!
**Reading configuration files**

I need to understand whether the project uses `next dev` or `vite`, so I’ll start by checking the `package.json`. I also want to look into `next.config.mjs` and `vite.config.ts` to get a clearer picture. It might be useful to check the deployment path, especially if it’s on GitHub Pages, which may require a specific base path. I plan to read all three files in parallel to compare their information efficiently!</details></think>

I'll check your project configuration to see whether you're using Next.js or Vite for deploy, and how static assets are expected to be served. Then I'll examine config files that could change asset paths (`next.config.mjs`, `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing image 404 errors**

I need to figure out why images are showing 404 errors after deployment. The project appears to be a Vite React app, but there's a next.config.mjs file that's a bit confusing. I'm seeing both Vite and Next.js configurations, which could mean this is a hybrid project. The Vite config uses a "build" directory as the public path, but there's also a public/images folder. It's likely that the asset paths are getting mixed up, especially when deploying to GitHub Pages.
**Configuring Vite for GitHub Pages**

When deploying a Vite app to GitHub Pages under a subpath, I need to set the base property in vite.config.ts to '/<repo>/' so that assets resolve correctly. If I leave the base at the default '/', the asset URLs will point to the root, leading to 404 errors. Images loaded via absolute paths like '/images/file.png' will fail since those paths don't exist at the domain's root. To prevent this, I should use relative paths or imports for referencing images. Additionally, I must ensure the React Router has the right basename.
**Investigating asset issues with Vite**

Changing the publicDir from the default "public" can lead to 404 errors, especially since assets in the original public folder won't be served. I see that there are images mentioned in both the public and build folders, but since Vite points to 'build' as the publicDir, files in 'public' will be ignored. Despite claims of images existing in the dist folder after build, they're still giving 404 errors upon deployment. I need to check how the component files reference image paths to troubleshoot this further. I'll search for references to '/images/', '@images', and 'public/' using grep.
**Checking image usage in Next.js**

I suspect the Next.js application could be using Next Image for handling images. So, I'll run some grep searches to dig into that. This way, I can find out how images are being referenced within the app. It's important to identify any specific code patterns that might affect how images are loaded, especially since they could be a factor in the 404 errors I'm encountering. Detecting the references will help me understand the situation better.</details></think>

---

I'll scan for how images are referenced in your code to pinpoint why they 404 in production (absolute paths, wrong publicDir, or missing base for GitHub Pages). I'll search for common patterns in components.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing image 404 errors**

It looks like I need to figure out why images are returning 404 errors on deployment. The project is a Vite React app, but there’s an odd Next.js config file present, which seems unused. The Vite configuration sets `publicDir: "build"`, indicating that Vite takes static assets from the `build` directory instead of `public`. The images are supposed to be in `public/images/`, and also possibly in `build/images`. I need to clarify how these paths are working together.
**Understanding GitHub Pages deployment**

I’m looking into why images might 404 when deployed to GitHub Pages at a subpath, like `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO`. The leading slash causes issues because the base path should be `/lavita-luxury-condos-2/`, which means I need to set `base: '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/'` in Vite. Using absolute paths in code leads to problems as Vite doesn’t rewrite these paths. I should stick to relative paths or use an import. A good practice is to import images properly or use the `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` prefix.
**Fixing image 404s on GitHub Pages**

I see another option to fix the 404 errors: maybe the user shouldn't use a GitHub Pages subpath, but instead deploy at the root domain. They mentioned having images in `public`, `build`, and `dist`, but the `publicDir` is set to "build." So the images in `public` aren’t used. When the code references `/images/...`, it points to the root path, which leads to those 404s. We could either adjust the assets or change `publicDir` back to "public" and maintain the repository name as the base.
**Analyzing project setup**

I'm noticing that the project has a `components/images/[...path]/route.ts` for Next app images, but this seems irrelevant—it might be imported from a template. The structure mixes Next.js with Vite since `package.json` identifies Vite, while the app has an `app/` directory typical for Next.js. The site is a Vite SPA with the `index.html` at the root. To deploy on GitHub Pages, I need to set Vite's `base` to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/' and prefix image sources with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
**Fixing image paths and configuration**

It looks like static images are in `public/images`, but if the `publicDir` is set to "build," those images won't be included. The user mentioned images in `public`, `build`, and `dist`, likely due to manipulation. To resolve the 404 errors, I propose changes to `vite.config.ts`, setting `base` to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/' and updating all `<img src="/images/...">` to use a helper function for URLs.

Alternatively, I could add a `<base href>` in `index.html`, but since the code uses absolute paths, I need to ensure that leading slashes are removed or address them through Vite's configuration to maintain functionality while hosting in a subpath.</details></think>

---

I'll open `src/App.tsx` and `index.html` in parallel to see how the app references images and whether a base tag is present.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing deployment issues**

I see the user's question about their Vite React app where images are resulting in 404 errors during deployment. It looks like they're working with paths that aren't correctly set for GitHub Pages, particularly due to absolute paths that don't reflect the repository structure. Assets must be correctly referenced with a `base` option in the Vite config for the deployment path, or alternatively by avoiding leading slashes in the asset paths. I'll make sure to clarify this for them!
**Examining asset paths in Vite**

I see that the Vite config is set to use "build" for the `publicDir`, which is quite unusual since images are placed in `public/images/...`. They might have both directories but, since Vite looks for assets in "build," this could be causing issues. The absolute paths in the code also contribute to 404 errors on GitHub Pages. They should configure the `base` path correctly in Vite to match their repository name for proper deployment.
**Addressing image 404 errors**

The reason for the 404 errors on images seems to stem from the absolute paths and missing base configuration. The `<script>` tag in `index.html` is using a leading slash, which could break things. To fix this, we should set the `base` in `vite.config.ts` to `'/lavita-luxury-condos-2/'`, but I need to confirm the repository name. Additionally, updating `publicDir` back to "public" would align it with where the images are currently located, ensuring everything is set up correctly for deployment.
**Identifying configuration issues**

I see that the Vite configuration uses "build" for the `publicDir`, which means assets in the `public/` folder are not being copied during the build process. Since the code references `/images/...`, Vite would typically serve these from `public`, but with the current setup, they won't be available at runtime, leading to 404 errors. There's no `build/` folder at the root, just `public/images` and `dist`. This misconfiguration appears to be a key reason for the issues. I need to clarify this with the user!
**Finalizing Vite configuration changes**

There’s no `build` folder, so I need to adjust the `publicDir` in Vite to "public" to ensure the images are copied correctly. The absolute paths in the code for images must also be addressed to prevent 404 errors. Using a utility function like `withBase(path)` can help resolve asset paths correctly. I should also set the `base` in the Vite config to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/' and check `lib/utils.ts` to add the new function carefully without causing issues.</details></think>

---

I'll open `lib/utils.ts` to see if we can add a helper for base-prefixed asset URLs without breaking existing exports.

---

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing image issues**

I need to figure out the 404 errors for images upon deployment. This project is built with Vite, but there's a Next.js configuration file present that might not be used. The Vite configuration shows the public directory set to "build," meaning static files are expected in the build folder instead of public. The project has images in both the public and possible build folders, leading to potential confusion. At development time, warnings appear for the missing public directory, but this issue causes the images to result in 404 errors in production since they weren't copied to the dist folder.
**Addressing image path issues**

I need to consider how Vite serves files from the root at /images, which points to `build/images`, but there are no images there—only in `public/images`. This mismatch leads to 404 errors during deployment. Local environments work because resources load from `public`, while Vite defaults to using "public" as the directory, which is overridden to "build" here. Since assets are in `public`, they won't be copied, and references to absolute paths `/images/...` conflict with the GitHub Pages setup. 

I see two problems here: 

1. The public directory mismatch: either move assets to `build/` or change `publicDir` back to "public." 
2. The base path for GitHub Pages: I need to set Vite’s `base` option to `'/repo-name/'`, or alternatively, use relative paths.
**Updating HTML scripts for deployment**

I need to update the `index.html` to ensure the script source path uses a relative reference. The current `src="/src/main.tsx"` will break on GitHub Pages since it should be `src="/repo-name/src/main.tsx"`. Alternatively, setting Vite’s `base` option will handle that automatically. During development, `base` doesn’t apply, but for production, it prefixes asset URLs. Since the repository deploys `dist` to the gh-pages branch, I also need to ensure that the base path is set correctly in accordance with GitHub Pages conventions. 

It seems that image references like `/images/*` will also be affected by this `base`, as Vite only transforms script and style links. If I use absolute paths with the leading slash, the browser may ignore the base tag, leading to further issues. However, Vite is supposed to inject a `<base href="/repo-name/">` tag into the built HTML, though I'm unsure if this will rewrite strings in the runtime HTML.
**Fixing image paths for GitHub Pages**

In the code, I see that using the literal `/images/...` will resolve to the root of the domain, which breaks when the GitHub Pages project path is `/lavita-luxury-condos-2/`. One solution is to change all `src="/images/...` to `src={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + 'images/...'}` or create a helper function like `withBase('images/...')`. 

Using relative paths like `./images/...` changes based on the current page, leading to potential errors, so I should opt for `new URL('/images/foo.png', import.meta.env.BASE_URL).pathname`. Since Vite exposes `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, I need to set this for GitHub Pages and use `src={new URL('images/foo.png', import.meta.env.BASE_URL).toString()}`. It's safer to fix the code rather than rely on configurations.
**Updating file paths for GitHub Pages**

The `index.html` currently has an absolute reference to `/src/main.tsx`, which would result in a 404 error on GitHub Pages due to the base path. Vite transforms this during the build, creating `<script type="module" crossorigin src="/lavita-luxury-condos-2/assets/index...js">`. To fix this issue, I need to adjust a few things:

First, I’ll change `vite.config.ts` to set `publicDir` to "public" and set the base to `'/lavita-luxury-condos-2/'`. Then, I'll update image references to be base-aware, possibly using a helper function like `asset(path: string)` from `lib/utils.ts` to prefix paths with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. 

Since there are multiple components using `/images/`, such as Contact.tsx and Residences.tsx, I'll need to update many files. I also need to check InsideLights.tsx for dynamic image paths. This will streamline my changes and ensure everything works smoothly on GitHub Pages.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the components that reference `/images/...` to update them to use a base-aware helper, and also open `components/sections/InsideLights.tsx` to check dynamic image paths.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing user's deployment issue**

I'm trying to figure out why the user is facing a 404 error when deploying images. They have images in their public, build, and dist folders, but it seems like Vite is set up to copy assets from the "build" folder to the "dist" folder. The user has "public/images" for their assets, but since "publicDir" is set to "build," those images won't be served. I see they have the necessary folder structure, so this seems like a configuration issue.
**Identifying issues with deployment**

I see that the user is having trouble with their 'build' directory, as it doesn’t seem to exist in the project root. Instead, they have 'public/images' and 'dist/assets' for build outputs. Vite's configuration is set to reference 'build/images', but that folder isn’t part of the repo, which creates a mismatch. Additionally, their index.html uses absolute paths which may lead to 404 errors on GitHub Pages. The user may need to adjust the base setting in their Vite config to rewrite asset URLs correctly.
**Addressing image path issues**

I noticed the user is referencing images with absolute paths like '/images/...', which can lead to 404 errors on GitHub Pages when served from a subpath. One solution is to set the Vite base to '/repo-name/' or use relative paths instead. It would also make sense to change `publicDir` to 'public' in the configuration to match where the images are stored. I should suggest verifying the repo name, potentially 'lavita-luxury-condos-2', or using relative asset paths to avoid these issues.
**Simplifying configuration for GitHub Pages**

I’m considering setting the base in vite.config to an empty string. According to Vite docs, the default base is '/', but for GitHub Pages, it should be set to '/repo/'. The script in index.html should use relative paths, which allows Vite to automatically handle references like `/src/main.tsx`. However, plain strings for images won't be processed dynamically unless I import them. Using the import.meta.env.BASE_URL helper function to prefix the base could prevent 404 errors on GitHub Pages.
**Implementing image path adjustments**

For a quick fix, I plan to modify all image sources from `src="/images/...` to `src={withBase('/images/...')}` using a new helper function to construct the base URL. This change will ensure images are correctly referenced on GitHub Pages. I also need to adjust the Vite `publicDir` setting to 'public' instead of 'build', as that's where the images currently reside. I should implement these updates in `vite.config.ts` and ensure that the base URL is set correctly for the project structure to avoid 404s.
**Adjusting image references and routing**

To fix the 404 errors with images on GitHub Pages, I plan to first update the `publicDir` in `vite.config.ts` to 'public'. This change ensures that images located in 'public/images' are accessible during both development and production. Next, I’ll implement a `withBase` helper function to handle image paths correctly. I think I’ll also consider setting the base to './' for improved compatibility across different environments, ensuring that all image paths build correctly with the appropriate base. I'll update several components to incorporate this new approach efficiently.</details></think>

---

I’m going to update the Vite config to serve assets from the `public` directory and make asset URLs base-aware, then add a helper `withBase` and replace absolute image paths in components to use it so they resolve correctly in production.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating configuration settings**

I added withBase, so now I need to update the components to use withBase as well. InsideLights also needs to build URLs with withBase. I noticed that the Vite config specifies publicDir as "build." Currently, the images are in public/images, but Vite expects them to be in the "build" directory, which might be causing issues with assets not copying. That means they should be placed in the build root folder to be properly served. I see there's an app/build instead of a top-level build folder.
**Checking build folder issues**

It seems there's no build folder in layout, but I found "app/images/[...path]/route.ts" and noticed that the Vite config sets the alias @images to "build/images." However, there's no build/images directory in the repo snapshot, which could cause issues since they set publicDir to "build.” This means no assets would be copied. Since images are in public/images, Vite might ignore them due to the changed publicDir, leading to 404 errors after deploy. Additionally, for GitHub Pages deployment, I'd need to set the Vite base correctly to avoid issues with asset paths.
**Fixing Vite configuration**

In the Vite config, I’m noticing that I can read from process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY or define a base from package.json homepage, but it seems they don’t have a homepage set. To fix this simply, I could set the base to "/lavita-luxury-condos-2/" since that’s the repo name. However, I’d prefer not to hardcode it. It looks like they’re using GH Pages based on the deploy script in package.json, so I could set the base to "./" for relative paths. While relative paths generally work, there could be issues with client-side routing. We'd need to replace all src="/images/..." references with withBase("images/..."), which might mean editing many components. Ugh, that sounds daunting!
**Making configuration adjustments**

I can implement a minimal fix by changing the Vite config: set publicDir to "public" instead of "build" and adjust the base setting to be empty. With React Router, if I’m hosting at a subpath, I need to add the basename prop in <BrowserRouter>. If it’s on GitHub Pages under a repo path, I can set <BrowserRouter basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}> to aid in routing. Absolute paths like "/images/..." will still lead to 404 errors when using GitHub Pages since it's under a subpath. To solve this, I could either replace the "/" prefix with import.meta.env.BASE_URL in all components or add a <base href> tag in index.html referencing import.meta.env.BASE_URL. However, index.html can’t compute dynamic values, but I think Vite can inject %BASE_URL% during the build process.
**Implementing Vite configuration changes**

It turns out Vite uses %BASE_URL% for development, and I can reference this in index.html. However, in JS, I should use import.meta.env.BASE_URL. Since images in JSX are just code, I could define a helper called withBase, but changing every component feels daunting.

One option is using a service worker to rewrite paths, but that seems overkill for my small codebase. Instead, I will update all components like Contact.tsx and Residences.tsx to use withBase.

I'll also adjust vite.config.ts to set publicDir to "public" and the base accordingly to ensure proper asset routing with GitHub Pages. It seems best to set the base to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/' for deployment. Finally, I need to update the index.html script paths to avoid potential issues with leading slashes during development.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving image 404 errors**

I need to figure out why the images are resulting in a 404 error on deployment. I noticed the project is using Vite instead of Next, with the next.config.mjs file likely being unused. The Vite configuration specifies that the public directory is set to “build,” which causes it to copy static assets from that folder, ignoring public/images where the images actually are. There's also a base path issue for GitHub Pages that needs to be addressed.
**Analyzing deployment issues on GitHub Pages**

I’m using the gh-pages script to deploy to the gh-pages branch, and if my project serves from https://username.github.io/repo, the base path might be '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/'. In the Vite config, the base isn't set, defaulting to '/' which points to the root and causes 404 errors on GitHub Pages. Absolute paths like `src="/images/foo.png"` will break because they rely on being at the domain root. Also, the publicDir is misconfigured to "build", while my images are actually in "public/images". I need to confirm if a "build" folder exists since it seems to be missing.
**Understanding deployment issues with Vite**

It looks like during development or build, static assets aren't loading properly. Images referenced by absolute paths will only serve correctly if they are in the public root of the dist folder. Since Vite's dev server serves from the project root, that might explain why images work fine when running the dev server—they reference directly from /images. But for deployment, 404 errors seem to stem from GitHub Pages' base path and those absolute URLs. I should set the Vite `base` correctly, either to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/' or use the process.env.BASE_URL. I'll also ensure image paths are relative or base-aware.
**Updating build configurations**

I need to adjust the build for InsideLights since it currently uses '/images/inside-lights/...'; I’ll update that to use the `withBase` helper. In the index.html file, the script tag should reference the source as a relative path using the `%BASE_URL%` placeholder that Vite inserts. The recommended format is `<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>`, with Vite handling the base during the build process. I also need to ensure that image URLs in InsideLights are updated correctly. I'll check that components like GalleryFull, BuildingOverview, Contact, Location, Residences, Hero, and others reflect the changes.
**Scanning for image references and updating config**

I think there might be other images like for Navigation, so I’ll search for the pattern `src="/images/"` to find any remaining instances. I realize that setting Vite's `publicDir` to "build" is incorrect since static assets are in "public." If `withBase` references '/images', Vite will try to serve from there, but it won't copy contents from the "public" folder if `publicDir` is set to "build." So, I should change `publicDir` to "public" or remove it entirely.

Setting `base` correctly in the Vite config is also essential, especially for deployment on GitHub Pages. I’ll confirm if they’re using GH Pages or another platform and proceed with adjustments accordingly. Removing unnecessary aliasing like `@images` and updating the InsideLights component to utilize `withBase` is also on my list. I’ll run another grep to check for any remaining image references.</details></think>

---

I'll scan for remaining absolute `/images/` references to make sure we converted all, and update InsideLights to build URLs with `withBase`. Then I'll fix Vite config to use `public` and set a `base` for GitHub Pages.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing asset handling in Vite**

I'm examining how Vite handles images and assets when deploying on GitHub Pages. The main concern is that only the assets in the dist folder are relevant at runtime. If I've changed the public directory to "build" and it doesn’t exist during the build time, Vite won’t process those assets. I need to ensure paths are correct, making sure to set the publicDir back to “public” and adjust the base for deployments. Additionally, I need to prefix certain URL paths properly.
**Updating asset references in InsideLights**

I'm planning to update InsideLights to use `withBase`, ensuring the paths are correct for images. I also need to apply this update to other components like Location, Residences, Contact, Footer, and more. I'll make sure that images are built with `withBase` and that their `src` attributes reference `image.url` accordingly. Additionally, I have to adjust the `vite.config.ts` by setting the public directory properly and configuring the base path based on the deployment environment. I’ll ensure everything is functioning correctly for GitHub Pages.
**Configuring GitHub Pages for Vite**

I'm looking at how to configure Vite for GitHub Pages. The Vite documentation suggests exporting the base path to `'/repo-name/'`, while user pages use just `'/'`. I want to set the base to `'/lavita-luxury-condos-2/'` and make it overrideable through an env variable in package.json for the build script. I'll also add a detection method for whether I’m deploying to GitHub Pages, which I can manage by setting an environment variable in the build script. It seems like I need to tweak the configuration to get everything working smoothly.
**Updating Vite configuration**

I’m planning to modify `vite.config.ts` to set the base path for GitHub Pages using `process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, with a fallback option to `'/'.` For my project, I’ll define the repository name as `'lavita-luxury-condos-2'` and set the base accordingly. It seems like the best approach is to set the base to that specific path directly.

Additionally, I want to adjust the publicDir to `'public'` and update the alias to point to the correct images directory. I’ll ensure everything is set up smoothly for the build process!
**Verifying image imports**

I need to check if the code imports `'@images'` anywhere in the project. I’ll do that by running a search query, likely using `grep`, to scan the files for any references. It’s important to make sure that the import statements are consistent and functioning properly, especially after updating the Vite configuration. This way, I can ensure everything is aligned with the changes I’m making, and nothing gets overlooked. Let’s see what I find!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating Vite static asset behavior**

Vite's dev server serves content from 'public' or 'build' depending on configuration. Here, it's set to 'build', so it looks in 'build/' for images — but they might still show if paths from 'public/' match. There’s no 'build' folder, which could mean local images aren’t found unless referenced correctly. However, in the dist folder, it should copy over static assets. For GitHub Pages, manual placement of images in the dist folder is needed, but that could be overwritten during builds.
**Refining Vite configuration**

I’m considering a better approach by using the 'public' folder in Vite. I’ll need to adjust vite.config.ts to set publicDir to 'public' instead of 'build' and also configure the base path. Since the project has a Next config with an alias for '@images' pointing to 'build/images', we can likely ignore that unless needed. I’m updating components to use withBase and adjusting others like Contact and Location. Making the base path dynamic based on the environment is an option, but keeping it simple with Vite's support for relative paths could work better for GitHub Pages.
**Configuring base paths correctly**

Using base: './' can simplify deployments to various paths, but with BrowserRouter relying on absolute paths, image path issues might not be resolved. Since we shifted to using withBase, this leverages BASE_URL for configuration, setting ideal paths for GitHub Pages, like '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/'. For custom domains, we might use base: '/'. I can propose a `.env` variable for VITE_BASE_URL to streamline setups while keeping it simple. When set to '', Vite defaults to '/'. It's crucial to implement this carefully and fix the index.html script tag, ensuring it works correctly during builds and for the dev server.
**Updating component paths and configuration**

For GitHub Pages, the built index uses the correct base, but I need to fix the URL in `InsideLights.tsx`. Specifically, I'll replace the line at L107 to use withBase for the image path. I should also check `Navigation.tsx` for any images, especially the Lavita logo. Running grep again for '"/images/' could help, although previous searches returned only dist files. If there are references in CSS backgrounds, I'll approximate those. Updates are also needed in vite.config.ts, setting publicDir to 'public' and adjusting the @images alias. After making these changes, I’ll run the linter, skipping the `read_lints` tool since it's optional.</details></think>

---

I'll update `InsideLights.tsx` to use `withBase` when building image URLs and set Vite to use `public` as the static directory and add a `base` path suitable for GitHub Pages so assets resolve correctly after deploy.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing image issues**

I need to figure out the 404 errors for images in a Vite React app using BrowserRouter. Their images are located in public/images, but the Vite config sets the publicDir to "build," causing a mismatch. Additionally, the @images alias is pointing incorrectly. The app uses GitHub Pages so it's important to set the base path to the correct location. I'll have to adjust the base config so that script and image URLs don’t lead to 404 errors.
**Setting Vite base correctly**

I need to ensure the Vite base is set to the correct path for deployment on GitHub Pages. The base URL should correspond to the repository name, which is likely "lavita-luxury-condos-2." I can use defineConfig to set this, but there might be a challenge since I don't have access to the repo name directly. Vite can utilize an environment variable, or I could potentially pull it from package.json. However, I also need to remember that locally, there won't be any environment variable available during the build process.
**Exploring base configuration**

I’m considering using a relative base './' for the Vite app, which should work well on GitHub Pages. But I wonder if using BrowserRouter might cause issues with relative paths. It's important to ensure that assets are referenced correctly regardless of the path. Plus, I need to update the Router to include a basename, since the current setup doesn't have one, which would help with route resolution on GitHub Pages. I’ll update the vite.config.ts to set the base correctly.
**Updating Vite configuration**

I’m thinking about using base: './' for static hosting, which makes asset URLs relative. It’s also important to set the publicDir back to "public" instead of "build" since the static files are stored in public/images. If we keep "build," Vite might mistakenly treat that as where public assets are copied from. Additionally, the alias @images should be removed. I’ll make sure to update the Vite config accordingly, ensure the correct asset sources, and adjust the BrowserRouter to include the necessary basename.
**Implementing changes to Vite config**

I'm ready to make the necessary adjustments. First, I think I need to update the index.html module script to handle the base path correctly for Vite transforms. I also see there’s an irrelevant Next.js config for images pointing to build/images, so I should ensure that we import withBase correctly from the utils path. It’s important to keep the '@' alias in the vite.config.ts while removing only the '@images' alias. I’ll make the changes to the Vite config and update App.tsx to include the basename in BrowserRouter, then mention that we should run a build and deploy afterward.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing image 404 issues**

I need to respond to concerns about images returning 404 errors after deployment. I’ve reviewed the codebase, which uses Vite and React Router instead of Next.js. There’s a 'next.config.mjs,' but it’s not in use. The original Vite setup designated the public directory as "build," while images are actually in `public/images`. The project structure shows they could also be referenced from `build/images` via alias. Using absolute paths like `/images/...` causes issues on GitHub Pages if hosted under a different path, which likely explains the 404 errors.
**Resolving asset path issues**

In the index.html, I noticed that a leading slash could cause problems in the build because Vite rewrites asset paths automatically. By changing the base to './', I ensured that asset paths are relative, allowing images to be served correctly. We updated the code to use the withBase helper to include BASE_URL for images, adjusted Vite's base setting to './', and set publicDir to "public." For GitHub Pages, the typical recommendation is to use base: '/repo-name/', but './' works for static sites. I've also realized we need to set the BrowserRouter basename for route navigation, but this isn’t affecting the images any longer—those 404 errors should be resolved.
**Updating script paths and images**

I need to update the index.html script source, which is currently using an absolute import for '/src/main.tsx'. Although Vite rewrites this during the build process, keeping the leading slash should be fine since it's the entry point. I've checked that the images exist under public/images, and they do! However, I need to run grep again to ensure there are no remaining references to '/images/' in all component files like `Navigation.tsx`. I’ll also mention that the next.config is irrelevant and can be ignored, since it’s unused.
**Configuring Vite and build process**

Okay, so the correct directory for Vite is 'public/'. During deployment, only the contents of 'dist' go to the server, meaning images in 'build' won't be included unless they’re referenced properly. By setting publicDir to 'public', Vite will copy the images from there. I must ensure that the images actually exist in public/images. The dynamic content from 'InsideLights' is using withBase to build the correct URLs, which is good. Now, I think we should proceed to run the build with `npm run build` to check everything, and we should also update the deployment configuration since it currently uses gh-pages for the dist folder.
**Configuring Vite for GH Pages**

For GitHub Pages, setting the base to './' will create relative paths, but this can lead to 404 errors on refresh unless we implement a 404.html redirect. The typical solution is to copy index.html to 404.html. Now, regarding images, we should ensure they exist in the public/images directory. I’ll adjust the Vite config to set the base to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/' to match the repository name, which seems likely based on the workspace. Additionally, I'll ensure the BrowserRouter's basename aligns with this path so that navigation and image loading work correctly.
**Updating configuration and build process**

Alright, it's time for updates. I need to change the App.tsx file to set <BrowserRouter basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}> and also adjust the deploy script to use gh-pages -d dist. In the vite.config.ts, I’ll set the base to either process.env.VITE_BASE or '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/', which should be fine for static use. 

After that, I’ll make sure the dev server works properly by confirming that import.meta.env.BASE_URL is correct for development. Finally, I'll remove "publicDir: build" and change it to "public." Time to run `npm run build` to check everything!</details></think>

---

I'll update the Vite `base` to the repo path and set React Router's `basename` so routes and assets resolve under GitHub Pages. Then I'll run a production build to verify.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering build commands**

I need to provide a concise answer with minimal verbosity, but I recall the developer tools say to keep going until we solve the issue. I can use the command functions.run_terminal_cmd for terminal tasks, and I should run the build with either pnpm or npm. The package-lock.json indicates the project likely started with npm, so I'll choose to run npm install or npm ci to ensure everything's up-to-date, followed by npm run build to generate the necessary results.
**Reviewing index.html setup**

I need to clarify some points regarding index.html. It uses `script src="/src/main.tsx"`, which is fine for Vite, especially since it rewrites paths for production. The leading slash indicates an absolute path, which works for development and gets bundled properly in the build. I also made sure static assets are organized under the public folder. Setting the base to "/lavita-luxury-condos-2/" is correct for GitHub Pages, and using the `withBase` helper is good. However, there's a `next.config.mjs` file from Next.js present that isn't applicable here since we're using Vite.
**Searching for image references**

I’ve changed InsideLights to use `withBase` for building image URLs, which is great! Now, I want to check Navigation.tsx for any image references too. I'll search for "/images/" across the code while excluding the dist folder. We did this before and didn’t find many new results, but it's worth double-checking. We updated several components like Contact, Residences, and others, but I also want to consider the ThreeDView component for images, including CSS or style strings. I’ll search for the string "/images/" again to ensure we cover everything.</details></think>

---

Let me search for any remaining image paths and then run a production build to verify assets resolve with the new base and helper.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining image paths and fixes**

I’ve made some code edits to change absolute image paths to use `withBase` along with Vite configured for the base path `/lavita-luxury-condos-2/`. The user is having issues with images in various folders leading to 404 errors after deployment. It's important to explain that using absolute paths will result in errors because of the repo path. We've also updated the `publicDir` setting and ensured that the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` has the correct basename.
**Building and verifying the project**

I’m getting ready to build the project to verify that everything works correctly. The developer instructions indicate that after making edits, I should run tests and build using either `pnpm build` or `npm run build`. I’ll use the terminal for that. After building, we could preview with `vite preview --open`, but it's not required. I’ll also need to explain that if deploying to a custom domain, I should adjust the base to "/" and check that the script source in `index.html` points to `/src/main.tsx` correctly to avoid issues.
**Verifying image paths and configurations**

I noticed that we also have Next.js files and a configuration file for Next.js, but since the app uses Vite, it may not be relevant. The earlier Next configuration had an alias for images that we no longer need. It looks like the TypeScript config still points to those images, but it shouldn’t pose any issues. I should confirm that the images are in the `public/images` directory, which they seem to be. Now, I’ll focus on running the build process and check components for image references to ensure everything works correctly.
**Checking tsconfig and running build**

The grep results indicate that the tsconfig alias is still referencing `@images`, which isn’t necessary anymore, but it’s not causing any issues, so that’s fine. Now, I’ll go ahead and run the build to ensure everything compiles properly. It’s important to confirm that the build process goes smoothly, especially after all the changes made. Let’s see how it goes!</details></think>

I'll run a production build to make sure the new base path and image references work without 404s.

cd /Users/limingkang/Documents/lavita-luxury-condos-2 && npm run build | cat

Short answer: 404s happen because your app is built with Vite and deployed under a subpath (e.g., GitHub Pages), but images were referenced with absolute paths like `/images/...`. In production those point to the domain root, not your repo subpath, so they 404.

What I changed:
- Vite base/public
  - Set `base` to the repo path so assets and router work when deployed under `/lavita-luxury-condos-2/`.
  - Switched static directory to `public` (Vite default) so `/images/...` exists in the final `dist`.
- Base-aware helper
  - Added `withBase` in `lib/utils.ts` and replaced all image `src` and dynamic URLs to use it.
- Router basename
  - Set `BrowserRouter` `basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}` so routes and links resolve under the subpath.
- Updated all components that used `/images/...` to use `withBase(...)`.
- Production build completed successfully.

What you need to do when deploying:
- If deploying to GitHub Pages at username.github.io/lavita-luxury-condos-2:
  - Keep `vite.config.ts` `base: "/lavita-luxury-condos-2/"`.
  - Run: npm run build, then npm run deploy (your `deploy` script publishes `dist`).
- If deploying to a custom domain or root path:
  - Set `base: "/"` in `vite.config.ts`.
  - The `withBase` helper will still work.

Notes:
- I removed the unused `@images` alias and moved static assets to `public/`. Your images already live in `public/images/...`, so they’re served correctly in `dist`.
- Next.js config present is unused; this project runs with Vite/React Router.

Status:
- Built successfully with updated asset paths.
- You can deploy now; images should no longer 404.

- Updated `vite.config.ts`: `base: "/lavita-luxury-condos-2/"`, `publicDir: "public"`, removed `@images`.
- Added `withBase` to `lib/utils.ts` and updated `src/App.tsx` to use `basename`.
- Replaced all `src="/images/...` with `src={withBase("/images/...")}`; updated dynamic URL builders and error fallbacks accordingly.

why this is happening, is there anything we can do therefore we dont need to call withBase everytime, but leverage image path directly ?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving image path issues**

I need to address the user's question about 404 errors for images and the use of `withBase`. They’re using Vite with GH Pages subpath, which adds some complexity. Previously, setting `vite.config` base to `./` worked, but with the new path, absolute references like `/images/...` break. Instead, we can use relative paths, but they depend on the current route. I can suggest adding a `<base>` tag in `index.html` to standardize paths and require switching to relative paths without leading slashes for React components.
**Adjusting image paths in Vite**

To address the user's image path concerns, I realize the HTML base tag only affects relative URLs and won't help with absolute paths starting with '/'. I can suggest changing references to "images/...", which may simplify things, though it means updating many files. 

Alternatively, I could explore if Vite could transform `/images/...` during the build, but that’s generally not possible. Instead, I can use imports for assets with Vite or move images into `src/assets`, allowing Vite to manage the base path automatically.
**Exploring image management in Vite**

I’m considering the challenge of managing many images. Moving them might be cumbersome, so I wonder if we can keep them in the public folder and use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` combined with a helper function. Another option is setting `base: "./"`, which allows all asset URLs to be relative. This way, we can adjust image references to use "images/..." instead of absolute paths. 

Adding a `<base>` tag in `index.html` with `%BASE_URL%` would also streamline this. Vite supports this placeholder, which could help maintain consistency.
**Simplifying image paths in Vite**

I can suggest setting `<base href="%BASE_URL%">`, which allows relative paths like `src="images/foo.png"` to work seamlessly. This way, we won’t need to use `withBase` if we switch all components to relative paths without a leading slash. Since many components currently use absolute paths like '/images', transitioning to 'images/...' might require some adjustments, but it's doable. 

To help avoid needing to call `withBase` constantly, we can use this base tag along with changing paths to relative. In development, BASE_URL would be set to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/', and Vite will adjust this accordingly at build time.
**Implementing base tag and path adjustments**

I need to address the user's issue with image paths. To resolve 404 errors, I can add `<base href="%BASE_URL%">` in `index.html`. This simplifies using relative paths like `src="images/foo.png"` without needing `withBase`. For code cleanliness, I'll also replace occurrences of `withBase(...)` with relative paths. 

Additionally, I need to remove any stray 'debugger' statements in `lib/utils.ts`. These changes should streamline the image path process while maintaining functionality within the Vite framework. It seems like a manageable plan!
**Making edits for clarity**

I plan to insert the `<base>` tag after the title in the HTML file, specifically right after the meta viewport on line 6. In `lib/utils.ts`, I should remove the 'debugger' statement and run the build again.

After these changes, I'll explain the reasoning to the user and suggest switching to relative paths in the future, along with listing options for importing assets. It’s crucial to keep my responses concise and clear while making these edits!</details></think>

I'll add a <base href="%BASE_URL%"> tag in index.html so relative image paths resolve automatically under the deploy subpath, and remove the stray debugger from withBase. Then I'll rebuild to confirm everything still works.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining path issues with Vite**

It seems we've attempted to patch lib/utils.ts, but the file had changed, so we need to read and patch it again. We also need to inform the user why they're encountering issues with absolute paths like `/images/...` on Vite + GitHub Pages, which leads to 404 errors. The solution includes using relative URLs for assets or updating the base path in the index.html to ensure proper linking. I'll ensure to incorporate this information in our response!
**Clarifying image path solutions**

I could suggest reverting to using relative paths or checking if using `withBase` is necessary. If assets need to be imported from the `public/` folder, referencing them as `/images/...` works if the base is root, but for subpaths, we should use the `<base>` tag and relative references. We could also set the `base` in the Vite config to '/lavita-luxury-condos-2/', but absolute paths still won't work. Changing image sources to relative paths like 'images/file.png' can help resolve issues under the base.
**Exploring alternatives to withBase**

We can avoid using `withBase` by adding a `<base href="%BASE_URL%">` tag, which we've already implemented, and by converting all image sources to relative paths without leading slashes. Alternatively, we could remove the BrowserRouter basename, but that could affect routing. Adjusting GitHub Pages for a custom domain might also help. Given the base tag, we can switch to bare relative `images/...`. Since many replacements were already made, we could create a custom `Image` component to automate this process if the user prefers not calling `withBase`.
**Simplifying path resolutions**

The minimal solution is to use relative paths in the code rather than absolute ones, as the `<base>` tag will help them resolve correctly. In React with TSX, image paths, often found in components, will still work. We should consider removing `withBase` or keep it until we refactor. The steps include adding the base tag, changing all image paths to be relative by removing leading slashes, and updating the InsideLights builder accordingly. I think it's best to remove `withBase` to avoid needing the helper altogether!
**Guiding changes for image paths**

This is quite an extensive task with many files to edit! The user is asking if there's a way to avoid calling `withBase` each time and leverage image paths directly. Since we've already added the `<base>`, we could change references to relative paths. We can use a grep replace to remove leading slashes in source attributes and strings. 

I'll ensure that we update all components to remove `withBase` and replace them with `images/...`. We also need to remove the debugger from `utils.ts` and check the indentation style while making these changes. Let's go ahead and execute these tasks!</details></think>

I'll remove the stray debugger from `lib/utils.ts`, then replace `withBase(...)` usages with plain relative paths like `"images/..."` leveraging the `<base href="%BASE_URL%">` we added, and adjust dynamic builders and error fallbacks. Then I'll rebuild to ensure no 404s.
